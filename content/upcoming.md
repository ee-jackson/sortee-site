## About SORTEE conferences

*Our conferences are informative, fun and low-cost*  
 

We want to facilitate lively exchanges of ideas, with three participatory event types:  
- **Unconferences:** Facilitated discussions of ideas for how to make ecology, evolutionary biology, and related disciplines more open, reliable, and transparent. Facilitation involves moderating the conversation with ideas and examples, but there are no formal presentations.

-   **Hackathons:** Group projects with well-defined goals (papers, techniques, software, protocols, organizations, etc.)

-   **Workshops:** Facilitators will teach tools to implement open, reliable, and transparent practices

 

We strongly encourage proposals for all contribution types from people at a wide range of career stages and from members of under-represented groups.

For facilitated sessions (Workshops, Unconferences, and Hackathons), we welcome proposals from small teams (as well as individuals). We encourage teams to include diverse perspectives, for instance with facilitators from different countries and balanced in terms of gender and career stage. Facilitation by early career researchers (students or early career postdocs) is warmly encouraged.

We encourage people with any questions about accessibility in the submission process or the events themselves to contact us via [conf.sortee@gmail.com](mailto:conf.sortee@gmail.com). Similarly, please feel free to contact us if you would like guidance as you prepare your proposals and submissions.
